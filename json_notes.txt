Use req.query when you want to extract data from the query parameters of the URL.
For example, consider a URL: http://example.com/search?query=apple&type=fruit. In this case, the query parameters are query=apple and type=fruit.


Use req.params when you want to extract data from route parameters in the URL.
For example, consider a route pattern: app.get("/users/:id", (req, res) => { ... });. In this case, :id is a route parameter, and it can capture different user IDs from the URL.
